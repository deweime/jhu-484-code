Web App Theme
===

A simple layout by [Andrea Franz](http://gravityblast.com) that you can use in your web applications. 
Inspired by cool themes like [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com/), [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/), [RadiantCMS](http://radiantcms.org/) and others,
it wants to be an idea to start developing a complete web application layout.
